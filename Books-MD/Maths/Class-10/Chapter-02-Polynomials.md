# POLYNOMIALS 2

## 2.1 Introduction

In Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall that if $p(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$, the highest power of $x$ in $p(x)$ is called the degree of the polynomial $p(x)$. For example, $4x + 2$ is a polynomial in the variable $x$ of degree 1, $2y^2 - 3y + 4$ is a polynomial in the variable $y$ of degree 2, $5x^3 - 4x^2 + x - \sqrt{2}$ is a polynomial in the variable $x$ of degree 3 and $7u^6 - \frac{3}{2} u^3 + 4u^2 + u - 8$ is a polynomial in the variable $u$ of degree 6. Expressions like $\frac{1}{x - 1}, \sqrt{x} + 2, \frac{1}{x^2 + 2x + 3}$ etc., are not polynomials.

A polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial. For example, $2x - 3$, $\sqrt{3}x + 5$, $y + \sqrt{2}$, $x - \frac{2}{11}$, $3z + 4$, $\frac{2}{3}u + 1$, etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials such as $2x + 5 - x^2$, $x^3 + 1$, etc., are not linear polynomials.

A polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name 'quadratic' has been derived from the word 'quadrate', which means 'square'. $2x^{2} + 3x - \frac{2}{5}$, $y^{2} - 2$, $2 - x^{2} + \sqrt{3}x$, $\frac{u}{3} - 2u^{2} + 5$, $\sqrt{5}v^{2} - \frac{2}{3}v$, $4z^{2} + \frac{1}{7}$ are some examples of quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any quadratic polynomial in $x$ is of the form $ax^{2} + bx + c$, where $a, b, c$ are real numbers and $a \neq 0$. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial. Some examples of

POLYNOMIALS

a cubic polynomial are $2 - x^{3}, x^{3}, \sqrt{2} x^{3}, 3 - x^{2} + x^{3}, 3x^{3} - 2x^{2} + x - 1$. In fact, the most general form of a cubic polynomial is

$$
a x ^ {3} + b x ^ {2} + c x + d,
$$

where, $a, b, c, d$ are real numbers and $a \neq 0$.

Now consider the polynomial $p(x) = x^2 - 3x - 4$. Then, putting $x = 2$ in the polynomial, we get $p(2) = 2^2 - 3 \times 2 - 4 = -6$. The value $-6'$, obtained by replacing $x$ by $2$ in $x^2 - 3x - 4$, is the value of $x^2 - 3x - 4$ at $x = 2$. Similarly, $p(0)$ is the value of $p(x)$ at $x = 0$, which is $-4$.

If $p(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$, and if $k$ is any real number, then the value obtained by replacing $x$ by $k$ in $p(x)$, is called the value of $p(x)$ at $x = k$, and is denoted by $p(k)$.

What is the value of $p(x) = x^2 - 3x - 4$ at $x = -1$? We have:

$$
p (- 1) = (- 1) ^ {2} - \{3 \times (- 1) \} - 4 = 0
$$

Also, note that $p(4) = 4^2 - (3 \times 4) - 4 = 0$.

As $p(-1) = 0$ and $p(4) = 0$, -1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial $x^{2} - 3x - 4$. More generally, a real number $k$ is said to be a zero of a polynomial $p(x)$, if $p(k) = 0$.

You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear polynomial. For example, if $k$ is a zero of $p(x) = 2x + 3$, then $p(k) = 0$ gives us $2k + 3 = 0$, i.e., $k = -\frac{3}{2}$.

In general, if $k$ is a zero of $p(x) = ax + b$, then $p(k) = ak + b = 0$, i.e., $k = \frac{-b}{a}$. So, the zero of the linear polynomial $ax + b$ is $\frac{-b}{a} = \frac{-(\text{Constant term})}{\text{Coefficient of } x}$.

Thus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial also related to its coefficients?

In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the division algorithm for polynomials.

## 2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial

You know that a real number $k$ is a zero of the polynomial $p(x)$ if $p(k) = 0$. But why are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the geometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical meaning of their zeroes.

MATHEMATICS

Consider first a linear polynomial $ax + b$, $a \neq 0$. You have studied in Class IX that the graph of $y = ax + b$ is a straight line. For example, the graph of $y = 2x + 3$ is a straight line passing through the points $(-2, -1)$ and $(2, 7)$.

|  x | -2 | 2  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  y = 2x + 3 | -1 | 7  |

From Fig. 2.1, you can see that the graph of $y = 2x + 3$ intersects the $x$-axis mid-way between $x = -1$ and $x = -2$, that is, at the point $\left(-\frac{3}{2}, 0\right)$. You also know that the zero of $2x + 3$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$. Thus, the zero of the polynomial $2x + 3$ is the $x$-coordinate of the point where the graph of $y = 2x + 3$ intersects the $x$-axis.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
Fig. 2.1

In general, for a linear polynomial $ax + b$, $a \neq 0$, the graph of $y = ax + b$ is a straight line which intersects the $x$-axis at exactly one point, namely, $\left(\frac{-b}{a}, 0\right)$. Therefore, the linear polynomial $ax + b$, $a \neq 0$, has exactly one zero, namely, the $x$-coordinate of the point where the graph of $y = ax + b$ intersects the $x$-axis.

Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial $x^{2} - 3x - 4$. Let us see what the graph* of $y = x^{2} - 3x - 4$ looks like. Let us list a few values of $y = x^{2} - 3x - 4$ corresponding to a few values for $x$ as given in Table 2.1.

POLYNOMIALS

Table 2.1

|  x | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  y=x2-3x-4 | 6 | 0 | -4 | -6 | -6 | -4 | 0 | 6  |

If we locate the points listed above on a graph paper and draw the graph, it will actually look like the one given in Fig. 2.2.

In fact, for any quadratic polynomial  $ax^2 + bx + c$ ,  $a \neq 0$ , the graph of the corresponding equation  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$  has one of the two shapes either open upwards like  $\bigvee$  or open downwards like  $\bigcap$  depending on whether  $a &gt; 0$  or  $a &lt; 0$ . (These curves are called parabolas.)

You can see from Table 2.1 that  $-1$  and  $4$  are zeroes of the quadratic polynomial. Also note from Fig. 2.2 that  $-1$  and  $4$  are the  $x$ -coordinates of the points where the graph of  $y = x^2 - 3x - 4$  intersects the  $x$ -axis. Thus, the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial  $x^2 - 3x - 4$  are  $x$ -coordinates of the points where the graph of  $y = x^2 - 3x - 4$  intersects the  $x$ -axis.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)
Fig. 2.2

This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial  $ax^2 + bx + c$ ,  $a \neq 0$ , are precisely the  $x$ -coordinates of the points where the parabola representing  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$  intersects the  $x$ -axis.

From our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ , the following three cases can happen:

Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS

Case (i): Here, the graph cuts $x$-axis at two distinct points A and $A'$.

The $x$-coordinates of A and $A'$ are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$ in this case (see Fig. 2.3).

(ii)

Case (ii): Here, the graph cuts the $x$-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident points. So, the two points A and $A'$ of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A (see Fig. 2.4).

(ii)

Fig. 2.4

The $x$-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial $ax^2 + bx + c$ in this case.

Reprint 2025-26

POLYNOMIALS

Case (iii): Here, the graph is either completely above the $x$-axis or completely below the $x$-axis. So, it does not cut the $x$-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).

![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)

Fig. 2.5

![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)
(ii)

So, the quadratic polynomial $ax^3 + bx + c$ has no zero in this case.

So, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two distinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a polynomial of degree 2 has at most two zeroes.

Now, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic polynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial $x^3 - 4x$. To see what the graph of $y = x^3 - 4x$ looks like, let us list a few values of $y$ corresponding to a few values for $x$ as shown in Table 2.2.

Table 2.2

|  x | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  y = x³ - 4x | 0 | 3 | 0 | -3 | 0  |

Locating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see that the graph of $y = x^3 - 4x$ actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.

Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS

We see from the table above that  $-2, 0$  and  $2$  are zeroes of the cubic polynomial  $x^3 - 4x$ . Observe that  $-2, 0$  and  $2$  are, in fact, the  $x$ -coordinates of the only points where the graph of  $y = x^3 - 4x$  intersects the  $x$ -axis. Since the curve meets the  $x$ -axis in only these 3 points, their  $x$ -coordinates are the only zeroes of the polynomial.

Let us take a few more examples. Consider the cubic polynomials  $x^3$  and  $x^3 - x^2$ . We draw the graphs of  $y = x^3$  and  $y = x^3 - x^2$  in Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively.

POLYNOMIALS

Note that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial  $x^3$ . Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see that 0 is the  $x$ -coordinate of the only point where the graph of  $y = x^3$  intersects the  $x$ -axis. Similarly, since  $x^3 - x^2 = x^2(x - 1)$ , 0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial  $x^3 - x^2$ . Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the  $x$ -coordinates of the only points where the graph of  $y = x^3 - x^2$  intersects the  $x$ -axis.

From the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic polynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.

Remark : In general, given a polynomial  $p(x)$  of degree  $n$ , the graph of  $y = p(x)$  intersects the  $x$ -axis at at most  $n$  points. Therefore, a polynomial  $p(x)$  of degree  $n$  has at most  $n$  zeroes.

Example 1: Look at the graphs in Fig. 2.9 given below. Each is the graph of  $y = p(x)$ , where  $p(x)$  is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of  $p(x)$ .

# 2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial

You have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial  $ax + b$  is  $-\frac{b}{a}$ . We will now try to answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial, say  $p(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 6$ . In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term  $-8x'$  as a sum of two terms, whose product is  $6 \times 2x^2 = 12x^2$ . So, we write

$$
\begin{array}{l} 2 x ^ {2} - 8 x + 6 = 2 x ^ {2} - 6 x - 2 x + 6 = 2 x (x - 3) - 2 (x - 3) \\ = (2 x - 2) (x - 3) = 2 (x - 1) (x - 3) \\ \end{array}
$$

Reprint 2025-26

POLYNOMIALS

So, the value of $p(x) = 2x^{2} - 8x + 6$ is zero when $x - 1 = 0$ or $x - 3 = 0$, i.e., when $x = 1$ or $x = 3$. So, the zeroes of $2x^{2} - 8x + 6$ are 1 and 3. Observe that:

$$
\text{Sum of its zeroes} = 1 + 3 = 4 = \frac{-(-8)}{2} = \frac{-(\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\text{Coefficient of } x^{2}}
$$

$$
\text{Product of its zeroes} = 1 \times 3 = 3 = \frac{6}{2} = \frac{\text{Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of } x^{2}}
$$

Let us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, $p(x) = 3x^{2} + 5x - 2$. By the method of splitting the middle term,

$$
\begin{array}{l}
3x^{2} + 5x - 2 = 3x^{2} + 6x - x - 2 = 3x(x + 2) - 1(x + 2) \\
= (3x - 1)(x + 2)
\end{array}
$$

Hence, the value of $3x^{2} + 5x - 2$ is zero when either $3x - 1 = 0$ or $x + 2 = 0$, i.e., when $x = \frac{1}{3}$ or $x = -2$. So, the zeroes of $3x^{2} + 5x - 2$ are $\frac{1}{3}$ and $-2$. Observe that:

$$
\text{Sum of its zeroes} = \frac{1}{3} + (-2) = \frac{-5}{3} = \frac{-(\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\text{Coefficient of } x^{2}}
$$

$$
\text{Product of its zeroes} = \frac{1}{3} \times (-2) = \frac{-2}{3} = \frac{\text{Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of } x^{2}}
$$

In general, if $\alpha^{*}$ and $\beta^{*}$ are the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, $a \neq 0$, then you know that $x - \alpha$ and $x - \beta$ are the factors of $p(x)$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{l}
ax^{2} + bx + c = k(x - \alpha)(x - \beta), \text{ where } k \text{ is a constant} \\
= k[x^{2} - (\alpha + \beta)x + \alpha \beta] \\
= kx^{2} - k(\alpha + \beta)x + k \alpha \beta
\end{array}
$$

Comparing the coefficients of $x^{2}$, $x$ and constant terms on both the sides, we get

$$
a = k, b = -k(\alpha + \beta) \text{ and } c = k\alpha\beta.
$$

This gives

$$
\alpha + \beta = \frac{-b}{a},
$$

$$
\alpha\beta = \frac{c}{a}
$$

Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS

i.e.,

$$
\text{sum of zeroes} = \alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a} = \frac{-(\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\text{Coefficient of } x^2},
$$

$$
\text{product of zeroes} = \alpha\beta = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{\text{Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of } x^2}.
$$

Let us consider some examples.

Example 2: Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial $x^{2} + 7x + 10$, and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.

Solution: We have

$$
x^{2} + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)
$$

So, the value of $x^{2} + 7x + 10$ is zero when $x + 2 = 0$ or $x + 5 = 0$, i.e., when $x = -2$ or $x = -5$. Therefore, the zeroes of $x^{2} + 7x + 10$ are $-2$ and $-5$. Now,

$$
\text{sum of zeroes} = -2 + (-5) = -(7) = \frac{-(7)}{1} = \frac{-(\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\text{Coefficient of } x^2},
$$

$$
\text{product of zeroes} = (-2) \times (-5) = 10 = \frac{10}{1} = \frac{\text{Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of } x^2}.
$$

Example 3: Find the zeroes of the polynomial $x^{2} - 3$ and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.

Solution: Recall the identity $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$. Using it, we can write:

$$
x^{2} - 3 = \left(x - \sqrt{3}\right) \left(x + \sqrt{3}\right)
$$

So, the value of $x^{2} - 3$ is zero when $x = \sqrt{3}$ or $x = -\sqrt{3}$.

Therefore, the zeroes of $x^{2} - 3$ are $\sqrt{3}$ and $-\sqrt{3}$.

Now,

$$
\text{sum of zeroes} = \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3} = 0 = \frac{-(\text{Coefficient of } x)}{\text{Coefficient of } x^2},
$$

$$
\text{product of zeroes} = (\sqrt{3}) (-\sqrt{3}) = -3 = \frac{-3}{1} = \frac{\text{Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of } x^2}.
$$

Reprint 2025-26

POLYNOMIALS

Example 4: Find a quadratic polynomial, the sum and product of whose zeroes are $-3$ and $2$, respectively.

Solution: Let the quadratic polynomial be $ax^2 + bx + c$, and its zeroes be $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We have

$$
\alpha + \beta = -3 = \frac{-b}{a},
$$

and

$$
\alpha\beta = 2 = \frac{c}{a}.
$$

If $a = 1$, then $b = 3$ and $c = 2$.

So, one quadratic polynomial which fits the given conditions is $x^{2} + 3x + 2$.

You can check that any other quadratic polynomial that fits these conditions will be of the form $k(x^2 + 3x + 2)$, where $k$ is real.

Let us now look at cubic polynomials. Do you think a similar relation holds between the zeroes of a cubic polynomial and its coefficients?

Let us consider $p(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 - 14x + 8$.

You can check that $p(x) = 0$ for $x = 4, -2, \frac{1}{2}$. Since $p(x)$ can have at most three zeroes, these are the zeroes of $2x^3 - 5x^2 - 14x + 8$. Now,

$$
\text{sum of the zeroes} = 4 + (-2) + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} = \frac{-(-5)}{2} = \frac{-(\text{Coefficient of } x^2)}{\text{Coefficient of } x^3},
$$

$$
\text{product of the zeroes} = 4 \times (-2) \times \frac{1}{2} = -4 = \frac{-8}{2} = \frac{-\text{Constant term}}{\text{Coefficient of } x^3}.
$$

However, there is one more relationship here. Consider the sum of the products of the zeroes taken two at a time. We have

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\left\{4 \times (-2)\right\} + \left\{(-2) \times \frac{1}{2}\right\} + \left\{\frac{1}{2} \times 4\right\} \\
= -8 - 1 + 2 = -7 = \frac{-14}{2} = \frac{\text{Coefficient of } x}{\text{Coefficient of } x^3}.
\end{array}
$$

In general, it can be proved that if $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are the zeroes of the cubic polynomial $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, then

Reprint 2025-26

MATHEMATICS

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \frac{-b}{a}, \\
\alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \gamma\alpha = \frac{c}{a}, \\
\alpha\beta\gamma = \frac{-d}{a}.
\end{array}
$$

Let us consider an example.

Example 5*: Verify that $3, -1, -\frac{1}{3}$ are the zeroes of the cubic polynomial $p(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 - 11x - 3$, and then verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.

Solution: Comparing the given polynomial with $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, we get

$$
\begin{array}{l}
a = 3, b = -5, c = -11, d = -3. \text{ Further } \\
p(3) = 3 \times 3^3 - (5 \times 3^2) - (11 \times 3) - 3 = 81 - 45 - 33 - 3 = 0, \\
p(-1) = 3 \times (-1)^3 - 5 \times (-1)^2 - 11 \times (-1) - 3 = -3 - 5 + 11 - 3 = 0, \\
p\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = 3 \times \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 - 5 \times \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 - 11 \times \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) - 3, \\
= -\frac{1}{9} - \frac{5}{9} + \frac{11}{3} - 3 = -\frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = 0
\end{array}
$$

Therefore, $3, -1$ and $-\frac{1}{3}$ are the zeroes of $3x^3 - 5x^2 - 11x - 3$.

So, we take $\alpha = 3$, $\beta = -1$ and $\gamma = -\frac{1}{3}$.

Now,

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 3 + (-1) + \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = 2 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{3} = \frac{-(-5)}{3} = \frac{-b}{a}, \\
\alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \gamma\alpha = 3 \times (-1) + (-1) \times \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) \times 3 = -3 + \frac{1}{3} - 1 = \frac{-11}{3} = \frac{c}{a}, \\
\alpha\beta\gamma = 3 \times (-1) \times \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = 1 = \frac{-(-3)}{3} = \frac{-d}{a}.
\end{array}
$$

$$
\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \frac {- b}{a},
$$

$$
\alpha \beta + \beta \gamma + \gamma \alpha = \frac {c}{a},
$$

and $\alpha \beta \gamma = \frac{-d}{a}$
